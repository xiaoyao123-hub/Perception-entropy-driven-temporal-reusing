This is the project code corresponding to the paper "Perception Entropy Driven Temporal Reuse for Real-Time Ray Tracing." This project uses the NVIDIA Falcor renderer, equipped with the OptiX denoiser, and leverages NVIDIA's shader execution reordering to accelerate multiple processes.



To run this code, you need to configure the Falcor renderer and the OptiX denoiser. Scene files can be found in [Rendering Resources](https://benedikt-bitterli.me/resources) A collection of scenes loadable in Falcor (pbrt-v4 format). The pre-rendering threshold can be found in scene_threshold.
